# 02464-Miniproject-1
Experiment about human working memory performance for the 02464 Artificial Intelligence and Human Cognition course at DTU

Free recall experiment:
- letters, numbers and symbols without replacement
- sequence of 20 letters
- csv file to store actual item and the guesses + included variables
- Variables:
   - delay before the recall (yes/no) 
   - presentation raten (high 0.5s/letter and low 1s/letter)
   - additional memory task before the recall: recall 5 letters in reverse order (yes/no)

Serial recall experiment:
- numbers from 1 to 9
- sequence of 10 numbers with replacement 
- rate: 1s/number 
- csv file to store actual numbers and the guesses + included variables
- Variables:
    - chunks: show the inverse number (1 2 - 2 1), exclude numbers with 0
    - articulatory suppression: repeating "eerb" 
    - finger tapping: square (yes/no)
