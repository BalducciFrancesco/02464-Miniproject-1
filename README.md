# Miniproject 1 — 02464 (Group 36)

This repo has simple web tools and data for two memory tasks: free recall and serial recall. 

## Course
This assignment is part of the DTU course [02464 Artificial Intelligence and Human Cognition](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02464).

## Deliverable
The project report is the main document: check it out [here](documentation/02464-Miniproject_1-Group_36.pdf).

## What’s inside
- Task pages: open [experiment.html](experiment.html) or [experiment-serial.html](experiment-serial.html) to run the tasks.
- Data: `data/` contains one folder per experiment configuration (each folder holds CSVs from trials).
- Analysis: a Jupyter notebook in [analysis/analysis.ipynb](analysis/analysis.ipynb) that loads the data and produces plots/tables.
- Components: webpage templates are in `components/`.
- Docs: lecture notes and the project report live in `documentation/`.

## Demo
Try the serial recall task online here:

## How to use
- Run a task by opening the corresponding HTML file in your browser, enter an ID, and do the trials. After each, download the CSV.
- Open `analysis/analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter, run the cells, and you’ll get charts and summary tables.
