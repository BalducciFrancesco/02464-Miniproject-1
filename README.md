# Miniproject 1 — 02464 (Group 36)

This repo has simple web tools and data for two memory tasks: free recall and serial recall. 

## Deliverable
The project report is the main document: check it out [here](documentation/02464-Miniproject_1-Group_36.pdf).

## What’s inside
- Task pages: open [experiment.html](experiment.html) or [experiment-serial.html](experiment-serial.html) in your browser to run the tasks. Each trial saves a CSV with `sample` and `guess`.
- Data folder: [data/](data/)
- Analysis: a Jupyter notebook in [analysis/analysis.ipynb](analysis/analysis.ipynb). Run it to see plots and summaries.

## Demo
Try the serial recall task online here:

## How to use
- Run a task by opening the corresponding HTML file in your browser, enter an ID, and do the trials. After each, download the CSV.
- Open `analysis/analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter, run the cells, and you’ll get charts and summary tables.
